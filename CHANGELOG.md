# Changelog

## Server Version 4.6.1 (16.04.25):
### Codename: Hop Master

### Fixes:
- Restore Config via raspberryPi did not work. Fix in system controller to check as well for 'application/zip' content type (Issue #162) (4.6.1.a1)
- Fix MuMM json recipe import (4.6.1.a2)

### Features:
- Add whirlpool hop functionality - cool down to target (default is 80C), add notification step to add hops prior to further cool down (4.6.1.a2)
- Add notification step in case of step temperature reduction (e.g. Matlasestep for Wheat beer) (4.6.1.a2)

## Server Version 4.6.0 (25-03-20):
### Codename: Hop Master

### Maintenance:
<strong>The existing version of the PT100/PT1000 plugin is based on a really old package to read the max31865 chip. It creates false readings on newer systems and requires the filter i implemented some time ago. I am currently working on a newer version which will require the adafruit_circuitpython_max31865 package in order to get values from the max31865 chip (development branch 0.2.x). Test show, that this is working without issues and without false readings. However, the adafruit package is ging to install several dependencies and these packages install either RPi.GPIO for older Pis or rpi.lgpio for the Pi5. With cbpi4 version 4.3.0 I changed to rpi.lgpio for all Pi boards to ensure compatibility for the Pi5 and reduce complexity for installation and the possibility to have only one pre-configured image for all boards. I have to break this and modify the setup.py in order to use different gpio packages for older Pis and the Pi5. 
I have already created a new branch in github with server version 4.6.x which takes this into account. If you have a Pi5, it'll use the existing rpi-lgpio package and you are good to go. Installation over the existing system should be no issue.
If you are using a Pi4 or older Pi, the setup.py will remove the rpi-lgpio and install the older RPi.GPIO which will cause issues. I have not yet found a workaround to get the existing pipx virtual environment running with an update. 
Remove the existing installation on your Pi4 or older board with 

`pipx uninstall cbpi4`

and install it again per existing instructions. Don't remove the RPi.GPIO package. Install all your plugins and you are good to go. The server will use the existing config. As always you should have a backup of your config.
I will merge the cbpi4 gpiotest branch soon into the development branch and if you want to test it, please follow these instructions. 
The new setup might also help for other hardware based plugins in future as one could use the adafruit hardware and drivers.</strong>

### Maintenance:
- Adapted Brewfather recipe import to Brewfather V2 API (requires UI version 0.3.15)
- No limit of 250 recipes for BF import
- Additional setting parameter in Settings on how many BF recipes can be displayed at once
- All BF recipes are called once when browser is opened to reduce API calls. In case of changes in brewfather (additional or changed recipe), upload page has now the option to reload recipe list.

## Server Version 4.4.1 (24-06-16):

### <strong>!!! libsystemd-dev requirement !!!</strong>:
- In order to change some code at a later point of time, you must install ´libsystemd-dev´ manually prior upgrading the server. In a fresh installation, this can be combined with the libatlas-base-dev installation -> documentation has been updated accordingly.
```
    sudo apt install libsystemd-dev
```
### Updated requirements:
- some requirements have been updated with respect to dependabot recommendations
- new aiomqtt version required some changes to the sattelite controller

### Fixes:
- Fix for import of KBH recipes: Temperature was somehow imported as string. Fixed but only integer values will be imported which is sufficient with respect to precision.
- Add system-python to requirements and change download of log data to prevent code injection (CVE-2024-3955).
- Remove restored config zip file from config folder.
- Add default values for fermenter hysteresis in case users don't enter a value.
- Some config adaptions to devcontainer files

### Features:
- Adapted Actor controller in order to support the [compressoractor plugin](https://github.com/pascal1404/cbpi4_compressorActor)
- Notification badge top right is now activated and notifications (up to 100) are stored. You can review/delete them, when you click on the badge icon.
- Show missing files in restore zip file content in case of issues at command line.
- Add range parameters to sensor hardware to enable different color in dashboard in case sensor value is out of range compared to target temp.

## Server Version 4.4.0 (24-04-15):
### Codename: Yeast Starter

## Server Version 4.3.1 (24-01-01):
- Fixed an issues for a fresh install.
- added asyncio-timeout package to the requirements as ait was missing with a fresh install. Obviously, some dependencies have changes with the change of the required packages in 4.3.0

## Server Version 4.3.0 (23-12-31):
### Codename: Winter Storm

- Update of some required packages

### RPi.GPIO is replaced with rpi.lgpio to accommodate compatibility with Pi5
- <strong>On Pi 4 and below you need to remove the RPi.GPIO package from your system prior installation of cbpi4 or prior update from 4.2.0 to 4.3.0. Please read the adapted installation instructions carefully prior upgrading!!!</strong>
- <strong>It is also required to install/upgrade cbpi4 now with the `--system-site-packages` parameter with pipx to ensure that all system packages are usable in the virtual environment. This may change later, but is currently required due to dependencies of rpi-lgpio.</strong>

## Server Version 4.2.0 (23-11-19):
### Codename: Indian Summer

cbpi version is available at [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/cbpi4/4.2.0a6/) or from the [github development branch](https://github.com/PiBrewing/craftbeerpi4/tree/development)

### Kleiner Brauhelfer import
- Craftbeerpi4 is now compatible with Kleiner Brauhelfer 2.6 database for recipe import. OlderKBH  database versions won't be supported with 4.2.0+

### Installation of cbpi won't require sudo and can be installed under other user with working autostart
- These changes (in particular removal of sudo requirement) are required for compatibility with newer OS versions such as bookworm.
- An update of older cbpi versions can be still done with the sudo installation as in the past. However, it is recommended to migrate to bookworm os.
- Migration to bookworm needs to start from scratch with an empty SD card as migration from bullseye to bookworm via dist upgrade is not recommended and most likely not working.
- For installation under bookworm, you need to use pipx instead of pip. This package must be installed first (see new Server Installation instructions).
- To run cbpi you need to run the command `pipx ensurepath` after installation of cbpi. Close the terminal and open it again. Then the cbpi command will be working.
- Pipx will create a virtual environment for cbpi4 and you need to install all plugins inside this virtual environment (see new Plugin installation instructions). The virtual environment is only required for plugin installation.
- cbpi onewire | setup | autostart and chromium commands must be carried out in your normal bash and not in the virtual environment. sudo is not required anymore and won't be working. 
- You should also be able to install cbpi under a different user than pi and have it starting with autostart. The file craftbeerpi.service in the config folder is replaced by a flexible craftbeerpi.template file that is adapted to the user you are logged into your terminal session. cbpi setup must be carried out in your home folder as in older versions (typically the folder you are in, when you open a terminal session).
- Backup your config on your existing system -> Install bookworm aon an empty sd card -> follow the server and plugin installation instructions. Restore your config file. You need to activate onewire, I2C, autostart,... on your new system. Although I have successfully tested bookworm incl. installation and everything on my productive system,  KEEP your SD card with the old system, until you have completed your first batch on the new system.

### Debugging: added `debug-log-level` parameter to config.yaml
- If not in config.yaml, default log level is 30 (warnings)
- You can add / modify the level in config.yaml and log level will be also adapted to server running in automode

### Dashboard: added hidden `gridwidth` parameter to settings
- will be used with upcoming UI to change the dashboard grid settings in edit mode on the fly

### Bookworm compatibility
- This cbpi version is compatible with bookworm os if installed with pipx (tested).
- Bookworm is now using wayland instead of X11 window manager as default. I have some issues with my touchscreen in combination with wayland but also the standard VNC did not work properly. Therefore I switched to X11 which is possible via raspi-config. You will find the option to switch under Advanced Options.
- Chromium Kiosk mode is working under X11. I have not tested this under wayland window manager.

## Server Version 4.1.10 (23-06-10):

### Individual Data logging can be now done via plugin (provided by prash3r)
- In case a developer wants to log data to different databases or files, data can be logged via plugin.
- As an example you can review the [influxdb logger](https://github.com/PiBrewing/craftbeerpi4/commit/e01850f2dc8fac02acd60685cceb071157dcf3ae#diff-107f71bd92549585a518ca8d6b3f6eb086d22d83614c75b4e3e3ac04afbaf38d)

### Adding global settings for a plugin requires now a source parameter

!!! Plugins with global settings (e.g. cpbi4-buzzer, cbpi4-system, cbpi4-Pushover, cbpi4-scd30-co2-sensor,.....) need to be updated to the latest versions !!!

- To get a better overview on the settings page, plugins that add global settings parameters need to use a 'source' parameter.
- With UI version 0.3.12, the settings page has a drop down menu at the top to select also settings for individual plugins.
- An example can be seen [here](https://github.com/PiBrewing/cbpi4-PushOver/commit/6ee61a35ae4d225737764d251e3cea074ef0d646#diff-73e2a5d205487d09c209cfcbcbc3f7a56568faa301b03209369859548932d00b)
- This example also shows  how to update parameters in case you want to change for example the description. Therefore, you can use also the source key 'hidden' and write the plugin version to the settings.
- Hidden parameters won't be shown on the settings page.
- Added function to remove global config parameters.

## Server Version 4.1.7 (23-03-30):

### Cryptography update may cause error 'X509_V_FLAG_CB_ISSUER_CHECK' or 'Illegal instruction'

For security reasons the cryptography package had to be updated to 40.0.0. This may cause an issue later when you are using pip. To fix it, please have a look [here](./cryptography_update.md) 

In case of the illegal instruction issue (armv6 based 32 bit systems), you can try to adapt the setup.py manually. However, there won't be any further support with older versions of cryptography due to security issues with older versions of this dependency.

### INFLUXDB configuration
- INFLUXDBADDR address must contain the full address incl. http(s) and port
- INFLUXDBPORT becomes obsolete
    - old: INFLUXDB: localhost | INFLUXDBPORT: 8086
    -> new: INFLUXDBADDR: http://localhost:8086
- INFLUXDBNAME: 1.8 => database name | 2.X or cloud: bucket name
- INFLUXDBPWD: 1.8 => password if required | 2.X or cloud: token
- INFLUXDBUSER: 1.8 => user if required | 2.X or cloud: organization

### Buzzer Tone via Browser
- PLAY_BUZZER  parameter has been added to global settings
    - Yes will enable buzzer tone via web interface (UI >= 0.3.11 required)

### Reduced sensor logging (integrated http, mqtt and onewire sensors)
- The sensor plugins that come with cbpi have an additional functionality with respect to logging.
- The user can assign a Kettle <strong>OR</strong> a Fermenter to the sensor
- The reduced logging frequency defines the reduced frequency of sensor logging. Readings will be still handled with regular frequency, but logging to CSV or influxdb is reduced. A value of 0 disables logging completely on inactivity.
- Reduced logging will be only enabled if a Kettle or Fermenter is specified for this sensor and if the Kettle or Fermenter is inactive (not running in auto mode).
- For the onewire sensor the reduced logging value must be larger than the regular logging/reading frequency.
- Example: Onewire sensor is reading data every second and you have set your brew kettle as Kettle for this sensor, you have further set reduced logging to 300. the sensor will log a value every second, while you are brewing in auto mode, but sends values to the log only every 300 seconds, when the kettle is inactive. If the reduced logging value is set to 0, the logging will only take place when brewing, but it is completely disabled when the kettle is inactive.
